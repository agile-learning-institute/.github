# the Agile Learning Institute

The Agile Learning Institute is a 501(c)3 educational nonprofit whoâ€™s mission is to provide free mentorship and one-on-one coaching services to support software engineers. We meet you where you are and accelerate your success. We work with partners to seek out and serve people who are under-represented in the industry. We also support an open Engineering Guild, that provides lifelong learning and peer support services to our members.
