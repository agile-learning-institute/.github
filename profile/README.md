# the Agile Learning Institute

The Agile Learning Institute is a 501(c)3 educational nonprofit whoâ€™s mission is to provide free mentorship and one-on-one coaching services to support software engineers. We meet you where you are and accelerate your success. We work with partners to seek out and serve people who are under-represented in the industry. We also support an open Engineering Guild, that provides lifelong learning and peer support services to our members.

Our one-on-one coaching and mentorship based approach allows us to offer Mentorship coaching services to individuals are not well served by traditional education environments. Our mentors are experienced professionals in the field with training in coaching, mentorship, and trauma informed care.

## Agile Learning

What is Agile Learning? Our learning process draws heavily on Agile software development techniques,  Software Craftsmanship standards, and Enterprise Design Thinking principles.

Following the Agile practice that favors responding to change over following a set plan, our curriculum is tailored to the apprentice and the learning styles that work for them. We revisit our goals and objectives after each success, and adjust as needed.

Following the Craftsmanship principle of not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value, our curriculum can adapt to changes in the industry like the rise of generative machine learning models. We find ways to constantly improve our curriculum and education options.

Following the design thinking roadmap model allows us to focus on what is most important Now, while keeping in mind the things we want to do Next or Later. This means, that we regularly loop around to the next subject and reassess our goals, priorities, and learning preferences to define a new Now scope for growth.

## Coaching Mentors

We believe that the one-on-one style of Coaching combined with the technical role of a Mentor provide the richest learning and career growth experience. Our mentors are certified in Coaching , EngineerKit based Mentoring, and Trauma Informed care.

## Life Long Learning

Software engineering is a field that requires life long learning, and we believe that the coach/mentor model provides value no matter where you are in your career. We meet you where you are,  from Apprentice candidates looking for an alternative to code school or university to a senior or distinguished engineer looking for opportunities to mentor in the field.
